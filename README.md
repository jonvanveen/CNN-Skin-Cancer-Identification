# CNN-Skin-Cancer-Identification

This project implements a convolutional neural network in Python (Keras/Tensorflow, sklearn) to perform MNIST-style image-based skin cancer lesion classification. It is based on [HAM10000](https://www.kaggle.com/kmader/skin-cancer-mnist-ham10000), a highly skewed dataset with seven different lesion categories. 

It was designed and presented with peers as a class project for the course Artificial Neural Networks at University of Wisconsin-Madison.

This repository contains the code implementation, slide presentation of project and results, and illustrations of network architecture and representative model evaluation metrics.
